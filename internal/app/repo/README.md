# Repository Package

- This package is reserved for repository or data access layer (responsible to handle entity data from persistent data)
- The repositories have been generated by [tools/entity-gen](./../../../tools/entity-gen/) for single table. Check the code generated [here](./../../generated/entity/).
- Nevertheless, the entity is not always the single table, it may be a combination/join of tables which not generated yet.
