## Study Case: Employee Clocking System

The project use employee clocking system as the study case
- For Client App 
  - [x] Clock-in
  - [x] Clock-out
- For Backoffice Dashboard
  - [x] Manage Employee
  - [x] Employee Clock History

## Notes 

- The project is OPINIONATED based on author knowledge and experience
- The project is PRAGMATIC, it use proven libraries/frameworks as much as possible without reinvented the wheel
- The project is MONOLITH BACKEND, you may need to customize code for microservices needs
- This is CONTINUOUS PROJECT, the author use it as his actual work and keep improve it
- The project is OPEN-FOR-DISCUSSION, feel free to ping the author for any feedback/question and/or open issue ticket

## FAQ

1. Echo VS Fiber? 

    [Fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber) is arguably better than [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) but is not compatible with [net/http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http) (it is based on [fasthttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp)). We use [go-oauth2](https://go-oauth2.github.io/) who only support `net/http`, therefore we choose to use Echo instead. 

2. Pgx for postgres? 

    [Pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) is a faster and more compatible postgres driver compared with [pq](https://github.com/lib/pq). There are 2 ways to use pgx: through [database/sql](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql) and direct implementation (which offer more capability) but not compatible with `database/sql`. We want to keep compatibility with `database/sql` to give flexibility to use other library.
